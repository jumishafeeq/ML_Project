# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction â€” Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
A Chinese automobile company plans to enter the US market and needs to understand the factors affecting car prices. This project builds predictive models to:

* Identify significant variables that influence car price.

* Quantify how these variables explain price variations.

The final model can help management adjust design, strategy, and pricing for success in the US market.

## Business Goal

* Model car price using various features.

* Enable understanding of pricing dynamics for a new market.

* Support business decisions on car design and positioning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available via this Google Drive link:  

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link.  

It contains various features of cars in the American market collected through market surveys.

## Project Workflow

The project follows these key steps:

### Loading and Preprocessing:

Loading the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

### Model Implementation: 

Training and evaluating five regression algorithms:

* Linear Regression
  
* Decision Tree Regressor
  
* Random Forest Regressor
  
* Gradient Boosting Regressor
  
* Support Vector Regressor
  
### Model Evaluation:

Comparing the performance of the models using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to identify the best model.

### Feature Importance Analysis: 

Determining the most significant variables that influence car prices.

### Hyperparameter Tuning: 

Optimizing the hyperparameters of the best-performing model to potentially improve its predictive accuracy.

## Technologies Used

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
